  /// This query calculates the @c Voxel::clearance() for all voxels within the query extents.
  ///
  /// For each voxel in the query expanse, the range to the nearest obstructed voxel (see @c Query) is calculated and
  /// written back into the voxel's @c clearance value. The range of the calculation is limited by the
  /// @c searchRange() and is not exhaustive.
  ///
  /// The query @c minExtents() and @c maxExtents() loosely limit the zone for which obstacle ranges are calculated.
  /// All voxels from all regions within the extents are calculated. That is, even a partial overlap with a range
  /// results in all voxels for that region being calculated.
  ///
  /// The CPU implementation performs a brute force O(nmm) where n is defined by the number of voxels within all regions
  /// in theÂ search extents, an m is defined by the number of voxels required to reach the @c searchRadius(). The GPU
  /// implementation is closer to worst case O(m) although it incurs additional, initial overhead. The GPU
  /// implementation is recommended over the CPU implementation.
  ///
  /// Both CPU and GPU implementations keep track of which regions have been previously calculated. Results are not
  /// recalculated for a region unless a hard @c reset() is performed.
  ///
  /// Note that the CPU implementation is more accurate than the GPU algorithm. The former directly calculates ranges
  /// to the nearest obstacles, while the latter uses an approximated flood fill. As a result, the GPU algorithm is
  /// optimistic and may report longer ranges than it should.
  ///
  /// The results written to @c Voxel::clearance() should be interpreted as follows:
  /// - 0.0 => The voxel in question is itself an obstruction.
  /// - > 0 => There is an obstructed voxel within the @c searchRadius().
  /// - < 0 => There are no obstructions within the @c searchRadius().
  ///
  /// This query respects the @c QF_UnknownAsOccupied flag, allowing unknown obstacles to be considered as obstacles.
  ///
  /// Note that for this @c Query the following methods are invalid, have different semantics or
  /// have no meaning:
  /// - @c Query::numberOfResults() not used.
  /// - @c Query::intersectedVoxels() contains no data.
  /// - @c Query::ranges() contains no data.
  ///
  /// Results are instead available via @c VoxelConst::clearance() or  @c Voxel::clearance().
